## NumPy Examples

## Definition
NumPy (or Nummpy) is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reson it is so important for Data Science with Python is that is that almost all the the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on
NumPy as one of their main building blocks.

NumPy arrays essentially come in two types:
1. Vectors are strictly one dimensional
2. Matrices are two dimensional (but you should note a matrix can stell have only one row or one column)
